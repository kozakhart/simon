# I am wondering if there is a way to not have to repeat my html
# over and over?
# I found that in django, you can use {% extends %}, put that does
# not work for this app
# I think that the table elements like tr and td are super useful!
# I will keep that in mind when I need to display data
# The biggest thing that I learned was how simple it is to link up # a js file. In the pst I made a django website and for some reason
# I went this really roundabout way by making a crazy link to a mjs
# file! I'm pretty sure I did not need to do that ha
